# JWST Photo Frame
These are the files for the JWST photo frame project, which I have detailed here: [James Webb photo frame project](https://m7n.nl/article/james-webb-telescope-project/).

## 3D print files
Here you can find the 3D print files I created for the column of my project. The files are also available on Tinkercad so you can edit them directly: [JWST column Tinker file](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/85FGorEiJzZ-jwst-column) and [JWST column support Tinker file](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/k7WFIqCUeIF-jwst-column-support). 

As I mentioned in my blog post, if you use them you should probably add a hole to the side of the column for the cables. Otherwise, feel free to edit them however you want!

## Automated startup script

This repository also contains the startup script I used. It's very small but maybe you'll find it handy :)
