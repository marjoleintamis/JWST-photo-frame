# JWST-photo-frame
Here you can find the CAD files I created for the column of my project. The files are also available on Tinkercad so you can edit them directly: [JWST column Tinker file](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/85FGorEiJzZ-jwst-column) and [JWST column support Tinker file](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/k7WFIqCUeIF-jwst-column-support). 

As I mentioned in my blog post, if you use them you should probably add a hole to the side of the column for the cables. Otherwise, feel free to edit them however you want!
