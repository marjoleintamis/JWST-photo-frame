# JWST Photo Frame
These are the files for the JWST photo frame project, which I have detailed here: [James Webb photo frame project](https://m7n.nl/article/james-webb-photo-frame/).

## 3D print file
Here you can find the 3D print file I created for the column of my project. It's available on Tinkercad so you can edit it directly: [JWST column Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/c7bSP5q6y5D-jwst-column-v2?sharecode=vhdbqFHLgmFPv5UFqaGXlf49ogCaL3pDNnznJGT1NAo). 

Feel free to edit it however you want!

## Automated startup script

This repository also contains the [startup script](https://github.com/marjoleintamis/JWST-photo-frame/blob/main/slideshow-script/jwst-script.sh) I used. It's very small but maybe you'll find it handy :)
